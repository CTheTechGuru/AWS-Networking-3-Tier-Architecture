<!-- PROJECT Details-->
 ## About The Project

In this project I will go through step by step how to architect a VPC environment consisting of a three tier architecture. 
This will consist of three layers.
1. Web Tier - Presentation also the UI of our users to access our applciation(ex: www.amazon.com). 
2. Application Tier - Backend aka logic layer. This layer is acts as the medium between to two Web and database layer.(user requests and data storing) 
3. Database Tier

With the current state of technology and its fast paced evoloution, businesses strive to maintain resilency as well as fault tolerance to handle work loads beyond measure. 
This is where the AWS makes it seamless to utilize cloud services on demand, opening up a plethora of options for building secure, highly avaliable, reliabile, and performance efficient applications.
